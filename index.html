<h2>Notice in the map below that the darker shades of red indicate that there is a further distance to travel from the suburb to the city. 
  Also the size of the dots depicts how expensive a suburb is</h2>
<div id="choropleth_map"></div>

<h2>Notice that the most expensive suburb in Victoria is Kooyong which represents the Stonnington City Council. 
  What is important is how the most expensive suburbs mostly come from the Boroondara City Council</h2>
